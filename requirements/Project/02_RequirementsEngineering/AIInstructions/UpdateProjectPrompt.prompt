"Hello AI, I need your assistance with updating our project's requirements and test case documentation. Please follow the specific processes outlined in our project's strategic documents.

**Primary Goal:**
Ensure that requirements\Project\02_RequirementsEngineering\use_cases.csv , requirements\Project\02_RequirementsEngineering\test_cases.csv, and requirements\Project\02_RequirementsEngineering\REQID_TCID.csv (all located in `requirements/Project/02_RequirementsEngineering/`) are accurately updated to reflect recent development work and new/modified test cases for [Specify Feature Name/ID and/or User Story Name(s)/ID(s) you've been working on].
If you see gaps in the current use cases of an analysed iteratioh in the way that they do not fully project the iteration goals show it to me.
If you see a user story not having at least two test cases, construct those testcases.
If you see a delta beetween the current test cases under folder simple_tests and the test cases list, close that delta by updatingn the test:cases.csv
After list updates, reexecute all testcases and exa<mine the results.
If there are errors in your test results, fix them and reexecute until you have poitive results or need advice
If the status in test_cases.csv does not reflect the current real testcase status after reexecution, update test_cases.csv 

**Key Guiding Documents (Please read and adhere to these):**

1.  **`PLATS.md` (`requirements/BestPractice/Project_Lifecycle_And_Testing_Strategy.md`):**
    *   Pay close attention to **Section 3: Requirements Engineering and Management** for rules on IDs, CSV formatting, and the overall process.
    *   Refer to **Section 3.4: CSV Formatting and Key Rules** for structural integrity, especially the requirements for Feature/User Story and User Story/Test Case linkage counts.
2.  **`CDP.md` (`requirements/BestPractice/Collaborative_Development_Process.md`):**
    *   Focus on **Stage 3: Implementation & Unit Testing**, **Stage 4: Local Integration & Fast System Testing**, and **Section 4: Continuous Activities - Requirements Tracking Updates**. This details when and how these CSVs should be updated during the development flow.
3.  **`GIP.md` (`requirements/Project/General_Implementation_Plan.md`):**
    *   Use this to understand the current iteration/phase context if needed, especially for deriving `Iteration` field values in `test_cases.csv`.

**Specific Tasks & Information to Provide:**

**1. Identify New/Modified Test Cases:**
    *   I have recently worked on [Briefly describe the feature/user story, e.g., "the user login module for User Story 03.01.01"].
    *   The new/modified test scripts are located in: [Specify path(s) to test files, e.g., `tests/unit/test_authentication.py`, `simple_tests/iteration3/test_login_flow.py`].
    *   Please scan these files and identify all new or significantly modified test functions/methods.

**2. Update `test_cases.csv`:**
    *   For each **new** test case identified:
        *   **`TCID`**: Generate a new `TCID` following the `XX.YY.TCZZ` format (where `XX.YY` is the Feature REQID, e.g., `03.01`, and `ZZ` is a new sequential number for that feature).
        *   **`TCTitle`**: Create a concise, descriptive title for the test case based on its purpose or the test function name.
        *   **`Status`**: Set to [Specify current status, e.g., 'passed' if you've run them successfully, 'untested', 'in progress'].
        *   **`TestSuite`**: The relative path to the test file (e.g., `tests/unit/test_authentication.py`).
        *   **`TestCaseName`**: The exact name of the test function/method (e.g., `test_valid_login_credentials`).
        *   **`Iteration`**: The current project iteration ID from `GIP.md` that this test case primarily relates to (e.g., `3.1`).
    *   For each **modified** test case, update its corresponding row in `test_cases.csv` if its `TCTitle`, `Status`, `TestSuite`, `TestCaseName`, or `Iteration` has changed.

**3. Update `REQID_TCID.csv` (Crucial Semantic Mapping - Human Responsibility Confirmation):**
    *   For each **new** `TCID` added to requirements\Project\02_RequirementsEngineering\REQID_TCID.csv, I need to link it to the relevant User Story `REQID`(s) it verifies.
    *   **As per `CDP.md` and `PLATS.md`, this semantic mapping is primarily a human responsibility.**
    *   However, you can help me prepare:
        *   List all new `TCID`s you've generated.
        *   For each new `TCID`, identify the User Story `REQID`(s) it *most likely* covers based on its `TCTitle`, `TestCaseName`, and the feature/user story context I provided above.
        *   Present these proposed mappings (REQID <-> TCID) to me for confirmation before you add them to requirements\Project\02_RequirementsEngineering\REQID_TCID.csv. If unsure, list the TCID and ask me to provide the REQID(s).
    *   Ensure no duplicate REQID-TCID pairs are added.

**4. Update `use_cases.csv` (If Applicable):**
    *   If any new User Stories, Features, or Epics were implicitly created or significantly modified by this work (less common for this specific update task but possible):
        *   Identify these based on my description of work.
        *   Propose new rows or modifications for `use_cases.csv` following the `REQID`, `REQType`, `REQTitle` conventions. (Confirm with me before applying).

**5. Health Check Awareness:**
    *   While updating, keep in mind the health check rules from `PLATS.md` (Section 3.4 and 5.3 of `CDP.md`'s reference to PLATS), particularly:
        *   Each Feature should have at least two User Stories.
        *   Each User Story should have at least two Test Cases assigned viarequirements\Project\02_RequirementsEngineering\REQID_TCID.csv.
    *   If your updates might lead to a violation (e.g., a new User Story with only one test case so far), please flag this.

**Expected Output:**

*   A list of proposed changes (additions/updates) to `test_cases.csv`.
*   A list of proposed new mappings for requirements\Project\02_RequirementsEngineering\REQID_TCID.csv (for my confirmation).
*   Any proposed changes for `use_cases.csv` (if applicable, for my confirmation).
*   A confirmation that all `TCID`s follow the `XX.YY.TCZZ` pattern.
*   Notification of any potential health check rule violations your updates might create.
*   Once I confirm the proposed mappings and any `use_cases.csv` changes, please provide the exact content to be written or the commands to update these CSV files.

**Important Notes for AI:**

*   Strictly adhere to the semicolon (`;`) delimiter and quoting rules for CSV files as defined in `PLATS.md`.
*   Do not make assumptions beyond the information provided and the content of the guiding documents. Ask for clarification if needed.
*   The final semantic link in `REQID_TCID.csv` requires human confirmation.

Please begin by confirming you have access to and have reviewed the referenced `.md` documents. Then, proceed with Task 1 (Identify New/Modified Test Cases) based on the context I've provided for [Specify Feature Name/ID and/or User Story Name(s)/ID(s)]."
