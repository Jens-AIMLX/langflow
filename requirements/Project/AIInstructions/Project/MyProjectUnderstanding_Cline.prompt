Based on the information I've gathered, I now have a good understanding of the project structure and the CSV files that need to be adapted. Let me summarize what I've learned:

1. The project is a FamilyWall Automation Project that uses Playwright for browser automation.
2. The project is organized into phases and iterations, with Phase 1 (Project Setup & Foundation) already completed.
3. The current CSV files (use_cases.csv, test_cases.csv, REQID_TCID.csv) contain data from another project (seems to be related to OKX/Nautilus Trader).
4. The test files are organized in a specific structure, with naming conventions that include iteration numbers and test types (e.g., 1_1_S_project_foundation, 2_1_U_auth, etc.).
5. The General Implementation Plan outlines the phases and iterations for the FamilyWall Automation Project.

I need to:

1. Clean the existing CSV files (remove the data from the other project)
2. Create new entries based on the FamilyWall Automation Project structure
3. Derive user stories and test cases from the General Implementation Plan and test files
4. Create the associations between user stories and test cases

I'm ready to toggle to

Act Mode (⌘⇧A) to implement these changes.

I've analyzed the project structure and CSV files, and I understand what needs to be done. Here's my plan for adapting the CSV files according to the process:

1. __Current State Analysis__:

   - The CSV files (use_cases.csv, test_cases.csv, REQID_TCID.csv) currently contain data from another project (OKX/Nautilus Trader)
   - The FamilyWall Automation Project has a different structure outlined in the General Implementation Plan
   - The test directories suggest a new naming convention (e.g., 1_1_S_project_foundation, 2_1_U_auth)

2. __Clean and Restructure Approach__:

   - Remove all existing entries from the CSV files
   - Create new entries based on the FamilyWall Automation Project structure
   - Follow the ID system conventions (Epics: 00, Features: 00.00, User Stories: 00.00.00, Test Cases: XX.YY.TCZZ)
   - Maintain the same CSV format and column structure

3. __Content Creation Strategy__:

   - Derive Epics, Features, and User Stories from the General Implementation Plan
   - Extract test cases from the existing test files and planned test structure
   - Create appropriate mappings between User Stories and Test Cases

4. __Implementation Steps__:

   - Update use_cases.csv with new Epics, Features, and User Stories
   - Update test_cases.csv with new Test Cases
   - Update REQID_TCID.csv with new mappings
   - Ensure each Feature has at least 2 User Stories
   - Ensure each User Story has at least 2 Test Cases
