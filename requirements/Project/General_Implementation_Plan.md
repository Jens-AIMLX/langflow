# Enhanced Filename Exposure & Metadata System: High-Level Project Specification

## 1. Introduction & Project Goal

### 1.1 Problem Statement
Langflow components traditionally receive UUID-based server paths for uploaded files, obscuring the original filenames and limiting the richness of file-related metadata available within flows. This hinders user experience and the development of advanced file processing capabilities.

### 1.2 Project Goal
To implement a robust, backward-compatible system within Langflow that:
- Exposes original filenames throughout the application.
- Provides access to rich file metadata (e.g., type, size, timestamps).
- Enables new and existing components to leverage this information seamlessly.
- Ensures no disruption to existing user workflows or component functionalities.

### 1.3 Scope
This project encompasses backend services, API modifications, database extensions, updates to the component framework, and considerations for frontend integration to support the enhanced filename and metadata capabilities.

## 2. High-Level Architecture

### 2.1 Architectural Principles
- **Non-Breaking Changes**: Existing Langflow functionalities and APIs (e.g., v1 file handling) will remain untouched and fully operational.
- **Parallel Implementation**: New V2 APIs and enhanced metadata systems will coexist with legacy systems.
- **Additive Database Modifications**: New tables/columns will be added for enhanced metadata; existing database schemas will not be altered.
- **Opt-in Enhancement**: Components and flows can gradually adopt new features. Legacy components will benefit from filename exposure through compatibility layers.

### 2.2 System Overview
The enhanced system introduces a new metadata storage layer that links server file paths to their original names and other attributes. New API versions (e.g., `/api/v2/files`) will handle uploads that populate this metadata. An enhanced component base class will allow components to easily access this information, with graceful fallbacks for legacy file inputs.

## 3. Key Features & Capabilities

- **Original Filename Preservation**: Components can access and display the actual filename as uploaded by the user.
- **Rich Metadata Extraction**: Access to metadata like MIME type, file size, modification dates, and potentially content-specific attributes (e.g., PDF author).
- **Full Backward Compatibility**: Existing flows and custom components continue to function without modification. Legacy components can still benefit from original filename exposure through intelligent fallbacks.
- **Enhanced Component Framework**: Base classes and utilities (`BackwardCompatibleComponent`) to simplify the development of components that utilize the new metadata.
- **Feature Flag Control**: Ability to enable/disable enhanced features at a system level.
- **Migration Path**: Utilities for migrating existing stored files to include enhanced metadata (details in technical documentation).

## 4. Implementation Phases

## 5. Testing Strategy Overview

This project adheres to the comprehensive testing protocols defined in `requirements/BestPractice/Python-Testing-with-AI-User-Collaboration-and-Iteration-Plan.md`.
The specific testing strategy for the Enhanced Filename & Metadata System includes:

- **Test Categories**:
    1.  **Environment Validation**: Python version, permissions, dependencies.
    2.  **Import Tests**: Module availability, graceful fallbacks.
    3.  **Schema & Model Tests**: Metadata creation, backward compatibility, DB operations.
    4.  **Enhanced Input & Adapter Tests**: File input classes, adapter functionality.
    5.  **Component Framework Tests**: `BackwardCompatibleComponent`, utility functions.
    6.  **Specific Component Tests**: e.g., `FileMetadataExtractor` functionality.
    7.  **Performance Benchmarks**: File operations, metadata lookup, caching.
    8.  **Integration Tests**: Component chain integration, metadata flow, API E2E tests.
    9.  **Backward Compatibility Tests**: Legacy component functionality, migration paths.
    10. **Regression Tests**: Ensuring no existing functionality is broken.
    11. **User Interface (UI) Testing**: Manual and semi-automated tests for UI display and interaction related to filenames (as outlined in `COMPONENT_TESTING_GUIDE.md` and `MANUAL_TESTING_GUIDE.md`).

- **Execution & Reporting**:

## 6. Installation and Activation

- The enhanced filename and metadata system is activated via feature flags (e.g., `LANGFLOW_FEATURE_ENHANCED_FILE_INPUTS=true` in the `.env` file).
- Installation scripts (`install_langflow_uv_140.bat`, `run_langflow.bat`) have been updated to support and verify the setup of these enhanced features, including automatic `.env` file configuration.
- Dependencies like Poppler (for PDF processing by components like `FileMetadataExtractor`) are managed as part of the Langflow environment setup.

## 7. Key Dependencies (High-Level)

- Standard Langflow dependencies (Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, etc.).
- Poppler: For PDF processing capabilities within components that might leverage file metadata (e.g., extracting PDF properties). Installation is managed by Langflow's environment setup scripts.
