# Langflow Project Overview: Enhanced Filename Exposure & Metadata System

## 1. Introduction & Project Goal

### 1.1 Problem Statement
Langflow components traditionally receive UUID-based server paths for uploaded files, obscuring the original filenames and limiting the richness of file-related metadata available within flows. This hinders user experience and the development of advanced file processing capabilities.

### 1.2 Project Goal
To implement a robust, backward-compatible system within Langflow that:
- Exposes original filenames throughout the application.
- Provides access to rich file metadata (e.g., type, size, timestamps).
- Enables new and existing components to leverage this information seamlessly.
- Ensures no disruption to existing user workflows or component functionalities.

### 1.3 Scope
This project encompasses backend services, API modifications, database extensions, updates to the component framework, and considerations for frontend integration to support the enhanced filename and metadata capabilities.

## 2. High-Level Architecture

### 2.1 Architectural Principles
- **Non-Breaking Changes**: Existing Langflow functionalities and APIs (e.g., v1 file handling) will remain untouched and fully operational.
- **Parallel Implementation**: New V2 APIs and enhanced metadata systems will coexist with legacy systems.
- **Additive Database Modifications**: New tables/columns will be added for enhanced metadata; existing database schemas will not be altered.
- **Opt-in Enhancement**: Components and flows can gradually adopt new features. Legacy components will benefit from filename exposure through compatibility layers.

### 2.2 System Overview
The enhanced system introduces a new metadata storage layer that links server file paths to their original names and other attributes. New API versions (e.g., `/api/v2/files`) will handle uploads that populate this metadata. An enhanced component base class will allow components to easily access this information, with graceful fallbacks for legacy file inputs.

## 3. Key Features & Capabilities

- **Original Filename Preservation**: Components can access and display the actual filename as uploaded by the user.
- **Rich Metadata Extraction**: Access to metadata like MIME type, file size, modification dates, and potentially content-specific attributes (e.g., PDF author).
- **Full Backward Compatibility**: Existing flows and custom components continue to function without modification. Legacy components can still benefit from original filename exposure through intelligent fallbacks.
- **Enhanced Component Framework**: Base classes and utilities (`BackwardCompatibleComponent`) to simplify the development of components that utilize the new metadata.
- **Feature Flag Control**: Ability to enable/disable enhanced features at a system level.
- **Migration Path**: Utilities for migrating existing stored files to include enhanced metadata (details in technical documentation).

## 4. Implementation Phases

## 5. Testing Strategy Overview

This project adheres to a comprehensive testing strategy. The specific testing plan for the Enhanced Filename & Metadata System includes categories such as environment validation, schema/model tests, component framework tests, performance benchmarks, integration tests, and backward compatibility tests.

- **Execution & Reporting**: All tests are designed for VS Code Test Explorer compatibility. Automated reports track status, times, and performance.
- **Reference**: For detailed feature-specific test plans, see `requirements/Project/01_Specifications/Testing/`.

This is complemented by a **Universal Testing Protocol** applicable project-wide, emphasizing AI-User collaboration, comprehensive coverage, and transparent documentation. Key aspects include:
- **Dual-System Testing Architecture**: A Development System for rapid iteration and an Integration/System Testing System for time-intensive tests.
- **AI-User Collaborative Verification**: AI executes tests, and the user verifies results via IDE.
- **Core Principles**: Comprehensive coverage, transparent documentation, and user verification.

## 6. Installation and Activation

- The enhanced filename and metadata system is activated via feature flags (e.g., `LANGFLOW_FEATURE_ENHANCED_FILE_INPUTS=true` in the `.env` file).
- Installation scripts (`install_langflow_uv_140.bat`, `run_langflow.bat`) have been updated to support and verify the setup of these enhanced features, including automatic `.env` file configuration.
- Dependencies like Poppler (for PDF processing) are managed by Langflow's environment setup.

## 7. Key Dependencies (High-Level)

- Standard Langflow dependencies (Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, etc.).
- Poppler: For PDF processing capabilities within components.
- Rust: Required for compiling certain Python package dependencies.

## 12. Universal Testing Protocol Summary

A key aspect of this project's quality assurance is the **Universal Testing Protocol for AI-User Collaboration**. This protocol is project-agnostic and establishes a framework for AI-assisted Python development with user collaboration and verification.

### Core Concepts:
- **Dual-System Testing Architecture**:
    - **Development System**: For code development, unit tests, and fast integration/system tests (real environment, <1 min execution).
    - **Integration/System Testing System**: For time-intensive tests (>1 min), performance testing, final acceptance, and regression testing (identical real environment).
    - Coordination via GitHub and comprehensive documentation.
- **AI-User Collaborative Verification**:
    - AI executes all tests and provides comprehensive evidence (logs, metrics).
    - User independently verifies results using IDE testing interfaces (e.g., VS Code Test Explorer).
    - Dual validation is required before proceeding.
- **Comprehensive Testing Coverage**: Every line of code must be validated. Full lifecycle testing (unit, integration, performance, regression).
- **Transparent Documentation**: Complete test logs, status reports, and preserved evidence.

### Workflow Highlights:
1.  **Development System**: Setup real environment, implement code, create unit tests, design integration tests, commit all to GitHub.
2.  **Testing System**: Sync from GitHub, set up environment, execute integration/system tests, document results, commit evidence to GitHub.
3.  **Development System**: Review results, resolve issues, iterate.

This protocol ensures robust testing, clear accountability, and high-quality deliverables. For detailed procedures, including VS Code Test Explorer setup, troubleshooting, specific test execution evidence templates, and failure handling, please consult the full document:
