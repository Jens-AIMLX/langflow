- **Timing**: After completing all detail iterations within a phase
- **Focus**: Reflect real system behavior rather than theoretical expectations
- **Activities**:
  - Analyze actual implemented functionality and integration patterns
  - Design test scenarios based on discovered system behavior
  - Define acceptance criteria aligned with phase objectives
  - Create comprehensive test plan with performance benchmarks
- **Deliverable**: Complete system test design document with test scenarios and acceptance criteria
- **Duration**: 1-2 hours for design and documentation

#### **Stage 2: EXECUTION**
**Purpose**: Execute the designed system test suite with full evidence collection

#### **Stage 3: FIXING**
**Purpose**: Address any issues discovered during execution through iterative fixing cycles
- **Process**: Each fix followed by regression testing and re-execution of failed tests
- **Focus**: Ensure existing functionality remains intact while resolving discovered issues
- **Activities**:
  - Analyze failed tests and identify root causes
